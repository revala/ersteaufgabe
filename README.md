# React + Vite Project

This project is built using React and Vite, providing a fast and modern development environment with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint integration.

## Features

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **HMR**: Hot Module Replacement for a seamless development experience.
- **ESLint**: Linting rules to maintain code quality.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/revala/ersteaufgabe.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
This will start the Vite development server. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 (or the URL provided in the terminal).

To build the project for production:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

To preview the production build locally:
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```

## Expanding the ESLint configuration


If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
